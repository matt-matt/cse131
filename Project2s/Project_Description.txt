To begin this project, my partner and I looked through all the starter code to try to understand what we are working with. We made sure we at least look through all the code/files before starting. After having some idea of what we are doing, we refered to the GLSL Specification to create all the grammar. We followed the Specification exactly when creating all the grammars and did nothing else. After we have all of them, we compile to make sure there are not any glaring critical errors. After that, we began to work on the action portion of the project. We had a lot of trouble starting this part. But after looking at the example from the starter code, the hints from Piazza, and the TAs from discussion/office hours, we began to get it. We started from the easier ones like {$$ = $1} then we worked on the harder ones like Operators, then eventually the other ones. We splitted up this part after we got the hang of it because it would take too long for both of us to work on the same part at the same time. During that time, we also had to modify the grammars from the GLSL specification to fit our needs and to pass the simple tests. Some grammars are merged into one so we can put the right arguments into the correct method. When merging grammars were not possible, we created structs with variables to hold the necessary information so we can pass these information into methods that ask more arguments than the grammar offers. We test our actions as we go and make sure that it passes what it needs to pass withe actions it has. After we finally have all our actions implemented, we tested it as a whole against the tests given by the TA on piazza. After we test and fix whatever bugs/errors we had, we tested our code against the student's test. We believe there are a few errors from the students' tests so we fixed whatever we think should be fixed and ignored all the other errors that are not acutal errors.
